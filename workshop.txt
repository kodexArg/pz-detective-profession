While not surpassing specialists like the Park Ranger in outdoor environments or characters with specific traits such as the Medic or the Hobo from the "More Traits" mod, the Detective excels in versatility. The synergy of their abilities stands out, and they have the highest vision range, narrowly outperforming the Veteran.
