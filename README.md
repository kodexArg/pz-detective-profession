# Project Zomboid: Detective Profession Mod

The **Detective Profession Mod** introduces a new character class with carefully balanced mechanics that seamlessly integrate into the vanilla Project Zomboid experience. The Detective offers unique urban foraging capabilities, vision bonuses, and a distinctive focus on danger detection while remaining fair and consistent within the game's existing mechanics.

## Features

### Profession Details
- **Name:** Detective
- **Description:** A meticulous observer with exceptional urban foraging skills and an innate ability to detect dangers. The Detective excels in smaller indoor areas and provides unique gameplay mechanics for identifying hidden threats.

### XP Boosts
The Detective starts with the following XP bonuses:
- **Aiming:** +1  
- **Lightfoot:** +1  
- **Sneak:** +2  

### Foraging Skills
The Detective specializes in urban foraging, comparable to the **Park Ranger** outdoors but optimized for urban and indoor exploration. She's also better than Veteran in search range (2.2 vs 2).

### Danger Detection - Unique ability
The Detective's unique danger detection system sets them apart:
- **Small rooms:** Optimized for identifying threats in confined spaces. She has great chances to detect lurking dangers.
- **Search mode advantage:** Dramatically boosts awareness, making hidden objects easier to uncover while searching.
- **Passive intuition:** Even outside of search mode, the Detective retains a small but notable ability to recognize subtle environmental clues or signs of danger, that could save your life (10%).

This system rewards careful movement and exploration, making the Detective a strategic choice for cautious players.

### Randomized Phrases
The mod includes an immersive set of phrases to enhance gameplay:
- **Search mode activation:** Over 100 thematic lines, such as "Let’s tread carefully..." and "A clue could be anywhere."
- **Danger alerts:** Context-sensitive warnings like "Someone’s been locked in here..." or "This smell... something’s rotting inside."

These phrases provide flavor without distracting from the core mechanics.

### Custom Clothing
The Detective spawns with a randomized selection of clothing, emphasizing their iconic role:
- **Fedora hat** (75% chance)
- **Long leather jacket**
- **Practical trousers and shoes** (default or denim)

## Mechanics

### Search Mode
Search mode transforms the Detective into a master of exploration and danger detection:
- **Enhanced perception:** Exceptional ability to uncover objects and identify threats in urban environments.
- **Dynamic bonuses:** Foraging skills, vision, and threat detection are all significantly amplified during search mode.

### Zombie Alerts
The Detective can issue contextual warnings when detecting nearby threats:
- **Small room specialization:** More frequent and detailed alerts in confined spaces.
- **Threat intuition:** Even without search mode, the Detective retains a modest ability to recognize subtle environmental cues.

This system leverages the game's mechanics to provide a sense of discovery and tactical foresight, making the Detective a valuable asset in any survival scenario.
